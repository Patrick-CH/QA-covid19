# QA-covid19

QA-covid19 is a Question Answering System based on KG (Knowledge Graph) and NLP (Natural Language Processing).



## Introduction

A knowledge graph, also known as a semantic network, represents a network of real-world entities—i.e. objects, events, situations, or concepts—and illustrates the relationship between them. This information is usually stored in a graph database and visualized as a graph structure, prompting the term knowledge “graph.”

We used a [covid19 knowledge graph](http://openkg.cn/dataset/covid-19-baike) from openKG.cn to build our system.

Different from other projects, we use a NER model and classifier to process the question.

QIC (Query Intent Classification) dataset and NER dataset is from [CBLUE(Chinese Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation)](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/cblue)

- app/  		 provides web service of our system, including web page and API service.
- QA_app 	provides a robot who can answer medical problems related to covid19.
-  classifier_model.py	 trains the QIC (Query Intent Classification) model
- graph  	  builds the KG in neo4j database



### Features 

We design the QA system with NER model and classifier instead of pre-setting rules and keywords, which would help our robot answer much more related questions.



## Requirements 

Windows and Linux system are both supported, but you have to meet following requirements:

- python 3.7 +
- tensorflow 2.5.0 +
- tensorflow-text 2.5.0 +
- py2neo 4.2.0 +
- neo4j 4.2.0  +

Besides, we recommend that you prepare a GPU with at lest 4GB Graphics RAM before running our system.



## Installation & Usage 

You can install our system by following steps:

downloads:

`git clone git@github.com:Patrick-CH/QA-covid19.git`

build the KG:

`python ~/Graph/build_graph.py`

run our system:

`python ~/app.py `



## Development 

Our system provide both web page and API service.

web page:	visit localhost:80 and you can see the web page.

API definition:

| method | path  | form-data                        | response                  |
| :----- | :---- | :------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| POST   | /chat | {"question": "example question"} | {"ans": "example answer"} |



## Changelog

V0: Our first version to validate the system framework.

V1: First publish version with relative abundant function.



## Branches

- Product (master ): stable version
- Develop (dev branch): latest version
- Feature: add new features (under development)
- Release: public release (under development)
